# Rock-Papper-Scissors

This is a project to further develop and practice skills in JavaScript.

Played in the web page's console, the user is prompted to throw either 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors.' 
This choice is contested by the computer's randomly-generated choice.

At the match's end, both choices are made known, as well as the user's result.
Five rounds of gameplay are executed, while keeping track of the running score between th euser and the computer.
